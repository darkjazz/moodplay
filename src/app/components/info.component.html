    moodplay.github.io is an online music streaming platform that allows users to collaboratively
    choose music by mood using web browsers which means it is accessible on any device.
    Users can participate in the global Moodplay party where everyone is added upon arrival,
    but they can also create personal parties that allows them to explore the mood space privately.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface is based on 2-dimensional scattering of tracks in a mood space derived from
    user tags in <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. Each track has been assigned
    coordinates that range between negative and positive on the horizontal axis and
    calm to excited on the vertical from bottom to top. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The music is automatically mixed by an automatic DJ module that models various DJâ€™ing styles
    using content-based audio features that represent musical parameters such as tempo, beats,
    bars, keys, instrumentation and volume to find the best match for next tracks in the
    continuous mix by tempo, tonality and timbre.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system consists of an <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> front-end and
    a <a href="https://moodplay-data.herokuapp.com/">server application</a>, implemented in
    <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express.js</a>, that stores track metadata, mood coordinates
    and audio features for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-dj">auto-dj3</a> module.
